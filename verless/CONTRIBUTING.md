## Reporting issues

If you encounter an unexpected behavior or a bug, feel free to
[file an issue](https://github.com/verless/verless/issues/new). When you do so, please make sure to ...
* include version information from the output of `verless version`.
* provide steps to reproduce the behavior.
* hide very long stack traces or logs in a [spoiler](https://gist.github.com/jbsulli/03df3cdce94ee97937ebda0ffef28287).

## Proposing features

Desire a new verless feature? Just propose your idea by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/verless/verless/issues/new) for it, there's nothing to lose!

Good feature proposals ...
* explain the problem that the feature solves.
* explain why it would be a desirable feature for the majority of users.
* bear in mind that verless should stay simple and lightweight.

## Improving documentation

If you've noticed something in the documentation that could be improved, please give us feedback. The easiest way to
request changes is to [file an issue](https://github.com/verless/verless/issues/new) or to fork the repository, make the
changes yourself and open a pull request. When you do so, please take note of our [Git conventions](#git-conventions).

## Contributing code

### Philosophy

Since verless isn't a company governed by customer expectations that have to be met for generating revenue, we try to
avoid quick-and-dirty solutions, workarounds and hotfixes at all costs. Instead, we strive for perfection,
maintainability and a thoughtful design. Working on the verless codebase should be fun!

### Git conventions

* Commit messages have to start capitalized and should be written in the imperative, e.g.
`Read markdown files concurrently`.
* If your pull request fixes an existing issue, refer to it with the issue number: `Fixes #19.`
* You may create a Draft Pull Request so reviewers can track your work and jump in early if there are problems.

### Coding conventions

Most importantly, there are some hard rules for code:

* All code has to follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.
* All code has to be formatted with `gofmt -s`.
* All exported types, methods and variables have to be documented briefly.

Some general recommendations:

* Avoid OOP and global state if possible.
* Prefer standalone functions that accept an input and return an output.
* Prefer short and concise variable names.
* Complex logic and edge cases in your code should be explained.

We are very supportive and helpful, so don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have while working with us. Thanks for contributing!
